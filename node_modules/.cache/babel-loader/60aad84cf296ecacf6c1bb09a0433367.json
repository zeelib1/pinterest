Leading actors to please any appetite. Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it. It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are \\\"real to you.\\\" It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.\")));\n}\n\nexport default Profile;","map":{"version":3,"sources":["/home/brontok/Desktop/pinterest/src/Components/Profile.js"],"names":["React","useState","useEffect","Profile","post"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,IAAeC,QAAf,EAAyBC,SAAzB,QAAyC,OAAzC;AACA,OAAO,oBAAP;;AAEA,SAASC,OAAT,CAAkB;AAACC,EAAAA;AAAD,CAAlB,EAAyB;AACrB,sBACI;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACG;AAAK,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,wIAAT;AAAkJ,IAAA,KAAK,EAAC,KAAxJ;AAA8J,IAAA,MAAM,EAAC,KAArK;AAA2K,IAAA,GAAG,EAAC,EAA/K;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,IADH,eAEA;AAAK,IAAA,SAAS,EAAC,YAAf;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,kBACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,eADJ,eAEI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,gsBAFJ,CAFA,CADJ;AAmBH;;AAED,eAAeD,OAAf","sourcesContent":["import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';\nimport '../Styles/Post.css'\n\nfunction Profile ({post}){\n    return(\n        <div className=\"postFlexContainer\">\n           <img src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1485846234645-a62644f84728?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1340&q=80\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" alt=\"\" />\n        <div className=\"commentBox\">\n            <h1>Comment</h1>\n            <p>Casablanca is a film about the personal tragedy of occupation and war.\n                 It speaks to the oppression of the one side - and the heroism and\n                 self-deprecation of the other.
